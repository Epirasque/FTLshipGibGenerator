GeneratedGibs Version 1.2.0

Quick guide:
1. Copy (not move!) your addon folder next to the GLAIVE.exe
   NOTE: If you had done this for a previous version of your addon then first delete that folder, do not merge them
2. Configure the config.ini as needed. Most importantly:
   INPUT_AND_STANDALONE_OUTPUT_FOLDERPATH has to be set to the name of the addon folder
3. Run the GLAIVE.exe and check the log for any errors
4. The folder from step 1 now has autogenerated gibs including suitable layout file entries
